                <h2>Channa Madra</h2>
                <p>1. Rinse 1 cup rajma (200 grams) with water a couple of times. Then soak rajma beans in enough water for 8 to 9 hours or overnight.
                    2. Next day drain all the water and rinse the rajma in running water. Drain the extra water. Place the rajma beans in a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker.
                    3.Add the following whole spices--- 1 inch cinnamon, 2 cloves, 1 tej patta and 2 green cardamoms.
                    4. Add 2.5 cups water. If you have used a larger cooker, then add more water.
                    5. Cover with lid and pressure cook on medium heat for 15 to 16 whistles.
                    6. When the pressure settles down, then only open the lid and check if the rajma has cooked well or not. The beans should mash completely when you press it
                       with a spoon or with your fingers. If the rajma beans are not cooked, then continue to pressure cook for some more time. Add some more water if required.
                    7. In a bowl, take 1 cup fresh full fat curd and whisk it till smooth. Keep aside.
                    8. Heat 2 tablespoons ghee or 3 tablespoons oil in a heavy pan or kadai.
                    9. Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds.
                    10. Let the cumin seeds crackle in the hot oil.
                    11. Now switch off the heat and add ⅛ teaspoon asafoetida (hing). Give a stir and mix well. Then keep the pan down.
                    12. Next add the beaten curd.
                    13. Quickly begin to stir the curd as soon as you add it.
                    14. Stir curd non-stop. Mix till curd and ghee is mixed very well.
                    15. Then keep pan on stove top on a low heat and continue to stir non-stop. If you stir non-stop curd won’t split.
                    17. After some minutes, you will see the ghee separating from the curd mixture.
                    18. Keep on stirring and cooking the curd.
                    19. Continue to stir till all ghee is separated and you see a layer of ghee floating at the sides and on few places at the top of the curd mixture.
                        Cooking curd takes an overall 10 to 12 minutes on a low flame.
                    20.  Then add the following spice powders one by one:

                    --½ teaspoon turmeric powder
                    --½ teaspoon cumin powder
                    --½ teaspoon garam masala powder
                    --1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder 
                    --1 teaspoon coriander powder
                    You can also add a few methi seeds and ½ teaspoon of fennel powder (saunf powder) if you want.
                    21. Stir and mix well.
                    22. Continue to stir for one minute.
                    23. Drain all the water from the rajma and add the cooked rajma beans in the curd gravy.
                    24. Season with salt as per taste.
                    25. Mix well.
                    26. Simmer the gravy on a low heat. Keep stirring occasionally.
                    27. The gravy will begin to thicken. Overall simmer for 11 to 12 minutes. You can add some hot water if the gravy becomes too thick.
                         After 11 to 12 minutes or when the madra gravy has thickened, then switch off the heat.
                    28. Serve rajma madra hot with rotis or steamed rice. You can garnish with some coriander leaves if you want.

                <h2>Siddu</h2>
                <p>A classic steamed bun with a savory lentil stuffing, this Himachali Siddu or Sidku is best served warm with ghee, during cold winters!

                    For the Filling
                    1/4 cup split Urad Dal (split black gram)
                    2-4 pieces Green Chili
                    1 inch Ginger, minced
                    1 tsp Cooking Oil
                    1 tsp Cumin Seeds (jeera)
                    1 small Onion, finely chopped
                    1 tsp Salt (adjust to taste)
                    1 tsp Turmeric Powder (haldi)
                    1 tsp Coriander Powder (or any spice you like)
                    2 cups Water (if making on a pan, refer notes)
                    For the Dough
                    2 cups Whole-wheat flour (Indian Chakki ka Atta) – or Refined Flour
                    1 tsp Sugar
                    1 tsp Instant Yeast
                    1/2 tsp Salt
                    1 Tbsp Oil or Ghee
                    1/2 cup Warm Water
                    For the Filling -- Basic Prep
                    Wash and soak the urad dal in water for 4-5 hours until the dal plumps up. Discard the water completely.
                    
                    Add the Dal to a blender along with the chili, ginger, turmeric powder, salt and any other spices you want.
                    
                    Without adding too much water, grind to a thick paste, and set aside.
                    
                    For the Filling: Method 1 -  -- Stovetop Cooking (on a Pan)
                    Heat a tsp of oil on a pan, add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
                    
                    Then add onions and turmeric powder and saute until translucent.
                    
                    Add the ground dal paste along with 2 cups of water. Mix well and bring to a boil.
                    
                    Simmer the heat, cover the pan and cook on low heat for 10 minutes or until the dal is partially cooked through. You're looking for a thick mixture.
                    
                    Once it's done, add chopped cilantro leaves (optional), and mix well.
                    
                    For the Filling: Method 2 – Steaming
                    Mix onion and oil with the dal paste. Taste and adjust for seasoning.
                    
                    Add to a steamer plate and steam for 10 minutes.
                    
                    When cool, add the cilantro leaves, mix well and set aside.
                    
                    For the Dough:
                    Mix together the flour, salt, sugar, instant yeast and warm ghee or oil.
                    
                    Add the warm water and mix until the mixture comes together. Knead for 7-8 minutes until you have a smooth and soft dough.
                    
                    Place in a large oiled bowl. Cover with a damp cloth or lid. Let it rest in a warm spot for 1-2 hours or until the mixture doubles or triples in volume.
                    
                    Forming the Siddu:
                    Divide dough into equal portions, and roll into neat balls. You can make one large siddu, cut into pieces and serve for ease, or you can make smaller, individual sized portions too. You can also make it shaped like a bun or a calzone.
                    
                    Divide the filling into portions and roll into balls too. This will ease the process of forming the buns.
                    
                    To shape like a Bun: Roll the dough into a 1/2 inch thick circle. Place some of the fillingin the middle. Bring the edges together to the center and seal. Then roll with your palm on the work surface to form a smooth bun.
                    
                    To shape it like a Calzone: Roll the dough into a 1/2-inch thick circle. Place some of the filling on one side of the circle, leave some gap on the edge. Fold over the other half onto the half with the stuffing. Seal the edges. Make a patter with a fork if desired.
                    
                    Cooking the Siddu:
                    If you have a steamer, place the formed siddu on it. Cover & rest for 20 minutes.
                    
                    If you don't have a steamer: Place the siddu on a plate lined with parchment paper. Bring some water to a boil in a pot, and place something on the bottom to raise the surface. Then place the plate with the siddu in the pan. This is a make-shift steamer for you. Close with a lid.
                    
                    Steam for 8-10 minutes or until the dough is fully cooked through. Insert a knife or tooth pick into one siddu, and if it comes out clean, it is done.
                    
                    Allow it to rest in the pan for 5 minutes. Then remove the siddu and store in an airtoght container.

             <h2>Maalpude</h2>
               <p>Step 1 Prepare Malpua batter
                 Malpua is a delicious recipe soaked in sugar syrup. Here’s a simple way of preparing this dish at home by following some very easy and simple steps. Take a bowl and mix together khoya, maida and sooji or semolina. Next,
                 add cardamom powder and mix well once again. Gradually add water to prepare the Malpua batter. Ensure that the mixture has a pourable consistency and is not too thick. Once the batter is ready, keep it aside for few minutes.
                 Take a small bowl and soak saffron in water to make saffron water.
                 Step 2 Fry the malpua and garnish with rabri and pistachios and serve
                 Now, heat oil in a pan over a low flame. When the oil is hot enough, pour a ladleful of the mixture and spread evenly. Keep the flame low and cook until the malpua is golden from both sides. Remove the cooked malpua and
                  drain the excess oil. Drop the malpua in sugar syrup and allow it to soak for 10 minutes. Repeat the same with the remaining batter. Drain the malpuas from the syrup, garnish with pistachios, saffron water and rabri. Serve immediately.
                  Tips
                  Let the Malpua batter rest for at least 6-8 hours for a better flavour.
                  Traditionally, Malpuas are made with maida. However, if you want healthier Malpuas, use atta or wheat flour. You can even mix them in the ratio of 1:1.
                  If you want lip-smacking Malpuas, then make the sugar syrup of 1-string consistency and don’t let it thicken.
                  You can also add some green cardamom powder and saffron in your Malpua for more flavours.

             <h2>Babru</h2>
             <p> Ingredients of Babru
                
                6 Servings
                3 cup wheat flour
                1/2 cup split black gram
                salt as required
                2 cup refined oil
                1/2 teaspoon baking powder
                water as required
                
                How to make Babru
                Step 1 Prepare a paste of the dal
                To prepare this delicacy first, soak black gram dal overnight or for 5-6 hours in water. Once done, drain the excess water and add the dal in a blender to grind it into a paste.
                
                Step 2 Knead a wheat flour dough
                Now, in a bowl mix wheat flour with 1/2 cup of refined oil, baking powder and salt . Combine all the ingredients well and using water knead a soft dough. Seal the dough airtight,
                 use muslin cloth if required. Leave it undisturbed for about half an hour.
                
                Step 3 Stuff the dal paste in the dough
                When the dough is prepared, take small portions of it and roll it flat using a rolling pin (similar to preparing a chapati). Now in the centre of each portion add the black gram paste.
                 Seal all sides of the potions to make sure the stuffing does not come out. Again roll it back to a circular shape similar to a poori.
                
                Step 4 Fry the babru and serve hot
                Now, in a wok heat oil over medium flame. Gently slip the prepared babru in the oil and fry on both sides until they appear fluffy and evenly cooked.
                 Transfer into a serving dish and serve hot with any vegetable, tamarind chutney or pickle.

                    In a heated pan, add oil, cumin seeds, garlic, broken red chilli, asafoetida, mustard seeds, curry leaves, and sliced green chilli.
                    Once the garlic achieves a golden brown colour, add onion slices to it.

                    After a couple of minutes, pour curd mixed with half a cup of water and keep stirring it until the spices are done and the mixture comes to a boil.
                    Add more water to adjust the consistency, and add kasuri methi and coriander leaves on the top. 
                    After a couple of minutes, serve the tangy, spicy, and flavourful gravy with rice and some pickles on the side.

                 10. Ajwain ½ tsp
                 11. Mustard oil
                
                
                 Other than those ingredients, you can also use spices according to your taste. People also like to put onion and garlic in their recipe.
                
                 How to Make Patrode, Himachali Dish?
                 You need to start with making a liquidy paste with besan, mixing all the spices mentioned above in besan (except the oil) with water and make
                 a paste of not-so-liquidy consistency.
                 Now wash the Arbi leaves. You need to spread one leaf on a broad utensil, or you can put it on a clean kitchen shelf. Keep the greener side down and cut the stalks.
                 Now using a spatula or your fingertips to spread the mixture on the leaf. Put another leaf over it and repeat the process for all the other leaves. Now roll the leaves altogether.
                
                 After that, take a momo steamer and fill its lowest compartment with water and keep the leaf roll on the upper compartment. You can also take a microwavable steamer for cooking the leaves. 
                 Keep the steamer on the gas for about 20 to 30 minutes. You need to keep an eye on the leaves to see if the leaves are cooked before time or will take more time.

                <h2>Bhalle</h2>
                <p>
                    Use half moong and half urad dal: like I said, my mother-in-law does this and I have learnt this from her. If you prefer a more prominent urad dal flavor, you can do 75% urad dal and 25% moong dal.

                    But I do 50-50!

                    Do not add a lot of water to grind the dal: just enough the grind them to a thick paste.

                    Don’t forget salt in batter: when grinding the batter, remember to add salt to it. 

                    Beat the batter using stand mixer: very important to aerate the batter and for that I usually use my stand mixer.

                   You can use your hand mixer or even use a whisk and mix with your hands until batter looks fluffy.

                    Once whisked well, batter will change color and become lighter, look aerated and almost double in size.

                    To test if it’s done, drop some batter in a bowl full of water, the batter should float. Which means it’s light and airy and ready for frying.

                   dahi bhalla cut into half to show the texture of the bhalla

                    Make equal sized bhalla by using a ice cream scoop: I use a mini ice cream scoop to drop bhalla into hot oil. This way they all are of similar size and I don’t have dip my hands into the batter either.

                    Heat oil at correct temperature: for the bhalla, the oil should be on medium heat. If too hot, the bhalle will become brown quickly but will be under-cooked from inside.

                   If the oil is cold, it will soak a lot of oil. So medium heat is what it needs to be.

                  Soak fried bhalle in warm water water for 15 to 20 minutes: once the bhallas are fried let them cool a bit and then dip them in warm (not lukewarm) water for 15 to 20 minutes.

                    The bhallas will increase in size and become really soft.

                  Then you squeeze water from each bhalla carefully by pressing between your palm and transfer to a container and add yogurt.
